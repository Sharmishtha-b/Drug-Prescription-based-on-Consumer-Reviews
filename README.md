# Drug-Prescription-based-on-Consumer-Reviews

This project is a Machine Learning-based system designed to help users make informed decisions about drug prescriptions by analyzing customer reviews. We leverage popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy for data processing and visualization. The project's main objectives include importing and preprocessing the dataset, summarizing the data, identifying hidden patterns, sentiment analysis of customer reviews, assessing drug effectiveness, and analyzing medical conditions associated with different drugs. The primary goal is to determine the most useful and least useful drugs for each medical condition based on user feedback.

### Overview
The "Drug Prescription Based on Customer Reviews" project leverages machine learning and data analysis to empower users to make informed decisions when it comes to drug prescriptions. By analyzing customer reviews, we've provided a comprehensive solution that not only summarizes and cleans the data but also goes a step further to uncover hidden patterns, calculate sentiment scores, and assess the effectiveness of various drugs. One of the primary objectives of this project is to help users find the most useful and least useful drugs for their specific medical conditions. This information can be invaluable in assisting both patients and healthcare professionals in making better-informed choices regarding treatment options. For this project, future enhancements and goals include expanding the dataset to improve accuracy, fine-tuning the sentiment analysis models, and creating a user-friendly interface for easy access and utilization. This project has the potential to play a significant role in enhancing healthcare decision-making and improving patient outcomes.
